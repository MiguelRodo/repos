## 2025-02-21 - Insecure Temporary Debug Logs
**Vulnerability:** Predictable temporary file names for debug logs in `/tmp` using `$$` and `date`.
**Learning:** Using `$$` and `date` to generate temporary filenames is insecure because it's predictable, allowing for symlink attacks. An attacker can pre-create a symlink with the predicted name pointing to a sensitive file (e.g., `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`), and the script will append to it.
**Prevention:** Always use `mktemp` to create temporary files. `mktemp` ensures exclusive creation, non-predictability, and restrictive permissions (0600). For maximum portability across macOS and Linux, ensure the template (e.g., `XXXXXX`) is at the very end of the argument to `mktemp`.
