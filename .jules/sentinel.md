## 2024-10-27 - [High] Insecure Temporary File Creation for Debug Logs
**Vulnerability:** Predictable temporary file names used for debug logs in `/tmp` (e.g., `repos-debug-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)-$$.log`).
**Learning:** This pattern is vulnerable to symlink attacks, where an attacker can pre-create a symlink with the predicted name pointing to a sensitive file, causing the script to overwrite it when run with debug flags.
**Prevention:** Use `mktemp` to create temporary files securely with restrictive permissions (0600) and unpredictable names. For portability between Linux and macOS, ensure the `XXXXXX` template is at the end of the filename (no suffix).
