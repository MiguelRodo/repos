## 2024-10-27 - [High] Insecure Temporary File Creation for Debug Logs
**Vulnerability:** Predictable temporary file names used for debug logs in `/tmp` (e.g., `repos-debug-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)-$$.log`).
**Learning:** This pattern is vulnerable to symlink attacks, where an attacker can pre-create a symlink with the predicted name pointing to a sensitive file, causing the script to overwrite it when run with debug flags.
**Prevention:** Use `mktemp` to create temporary files securely with restrictive permissions (0600) and unpredictable names. For portability between Linux and macOS, ensure the `XXXXXX` template is at the end of the filename (no suffix).
## 2025-02-21 - Insecure Temporary Debug Logs
**Vulnerability:** Predictable temporary file names for debug logs in `/tmp` using `$$` and `date`.
**Learning:** Using `$$` and `date` to generate temporary filenames is insecure because it's predictable, allowing for symlink attacks. An attacker can pre-create a symlink with the predicted name pointing to a sensitive file (e.g., `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`), and the script will append to it.
**Prevention:** Always use `mktemp` to create temporary files. `mktemp` ensures exclusive creation, non-predictability, and restrictive permissions (0600). For maximum portability across macOS and Linux, ensure the template (e.g., `XXXXXX`) is at the very end of the argument to `mktemp`.
## 2026-02-23 - [High] Path Traversal in Workspace Generation and Pipeline Execution
**Vulnerability:** User-specified target directories in `repos.list` were not validated in `vscode-workspace-add.sh` and `run-pipeline.sh`, allowing malicious entries to point to arbitrary locations outside the workspace.
**Learning:** Even if the primary tool (`clone-repos.sh`) validates input, secondary tools that parse the same input must also implement consistent validation, especially if they generate configuration (`entire-project.code-workspace`) that is subsequently trusted by other tools (`run-pipeline.sh`).
**Prevention:** Centralize input validation where possible, or ensure all entry points for user-controlled data implement the same strict validation rules. Always disallow absolute paths and `..` components in user-provided directory names.
## 2026-02-24 - [High] Path Traversal in Workspace-Consuming Scripts
**Vulnerability:** Secondary tools like `install-r-deps.sh` and the workspace loop in `run-pipeline.sh` blindly trusted paths in the VS Code workspace file, allowing path traversal attacks.
**Learning:** Even if the generator script (`vscode-workspace-add.sh`) validates paths, all consumer scripts must also implement validation. In this project, sibling repositories are intended, so exactly one leading `..` is allowed, but nothing more.
**Prevention:** Implement `validate_workspace_path` in all scripts that consume workspace files. The validation should permit exactly one leading `../` to support the sibling repo architecture while blocking all other `..` components and absolute paths.
